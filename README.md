# Image Search App

You can search for images by entering a query in the appropriate field. 15
images are loaded at a time. When the user receives the maximum possible page of
results for a specific search term, the **Load more** button disappears and a
corresponding message appears. The **Vite** bundler was used to build the
project.

## Libraries used:

- **iziToast**: for displaying notifications
- **SimpleLightbox**: for a modal window when clicking on an image in the
  gallery
- **Axios**: for HTTP requests to the Pixabay API
